#+title: "C server pages"


* What is it?

A templating language with embedded C syntax. 

* Why, AKA: Time is a flat circle

Inspired by a recent [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkNv3KGOFT0&pp=ygUHdHNvZGluZw%3D%3D][Tsoding Daily implementing the same idea]], I went
ahead and wrote one of my own, but with a {{ handlebars }} syntax to
avoid the %-escape issue Alexey mentioned near the end of the VOD. I
also added a file pointer variable so this could be used in-memory as
well.

I just found it funny because this is basically Java Server Pages
(hence the title) in C. Whether or not that is a good thing is up to
the reader.
